respect MappingNotify event
  i can't respect any MappingNotify event because i don't receive any input,
  thus i must grab a mapping of the keyboard and manually ensure the correct press.
  or i can create a fake invisible window to which i XTestFakeKeyEvent on in order to receive it
  as an event-- then i use the remap information to obtain the key remapped by xmodmap 
  (MappingNotify) to finally transmit it to the focused window.
